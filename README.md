# Metabolic Syndrome Prediction
## Objective:
To predict metabolic syndrome based on common risk factors

### Business problem:
   Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a cluster of risk factors including hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity. Metabolism-related risk factors include diabetes and heart disease. MetSyn is also linked to numerous cancers and chronic kidney disease. 
 All of these variables raise medical costs. Developing a prediction model that can quickly identify persons at high risk of MetS and offer them a treatment plan is crucial. Early prediction of metabolic syndrome will highly impact the quality of life of patients as it gives them a chance for making a change to the bad habit and preventing a serious illness in the future.
